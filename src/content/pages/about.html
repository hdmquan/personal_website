                I once gave a talk at DDD Melbourne on why not everything needs
                machine learning which, yeah, is a bit odd coming from someone
                who works in ML. But at the time, a lot of people were trying to
                force it into every problem like it was the answer to
                everything.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Working in AI, I’ve seen a fair bit of hype. Machine learning
                gets thrown at things it doesn’t always belong. I think it’s
                worth being clear about where it fits, and where it doesn’t.

                We built a trading system for the Australian energy spot market
                using real data from AEMO, goal was to maximize profit across
                simulated trades. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                We tried everything from traditional
                strategies with Optuna tuning, to reinforcement learning, to
                custom ML setups, but what stuck was a neural network trained
                on a custom loss: max profit - actual profit.

                For the pitch, we framed the idea from a business perspective —
                not just the tech, which helped us stand out. We ended up
                taking first place for the pitch, and second for the algorithm
                itself.
