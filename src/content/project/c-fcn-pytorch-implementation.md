This is a PyTorch implementation of C-FCN, a low power convolutional neural network for cloud segmentation in satellite images, as proposed in "Low-power neural networks for semantic segmentation of satellite images" (Balh et al.,Â [2019](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/LPCV/Bahl_Low-Power_Neural_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Satellite_Images_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf)).

In addition to implementing the original C-FCN architecture, this implementation includes an option to change the final layer to potentially improve accuracy. The available options for the final layer are:

* Bilinear Upscaling (original)
* 2D Transpose Convolution (scale factor: 4)
* 2x 2D Transpose Convolution (scale factor: 2)

This implementation also includes a skipped connection.
