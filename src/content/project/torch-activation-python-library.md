During experimentation phase for a HAB gondola Computer Vision model, I work with various activation functions to come up with the most lightweight as possible. Most of the activation functions weren't implemented in the official PyTorch library. Therefore, this project aims to provide an easy-to-use solution for experimenting with different activation functions or simply adding variety to your models.
